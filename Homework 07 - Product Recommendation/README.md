# Product Recommendation

## Dataset ðŸ“Š  
A survey asking whether or not the user (students from the class) has ever purchased/used an item. We received 44 responses, and each respondent rated each item from 60 items as Yes or No.

## Top Most/Least common items

## Association Rules
Running a market basket analysis. Here's the visualzation of 1-itemset association rules (filtered by support > 0.5 and lift > 1.05)

## Collaborative Filtering - Item Similarity
By using users' ratings for each item as its feature vector, cosine similarity values are calculated for each pair of items.  
We can recommend items based on item similarity.

## Matrix Factorization
Using NMF to decompose the Utility Matrix, we then get the mapping of user and item to the concepts in latent space. Both user and items can be visualized in the same Latent space as the chart below. Similar items/users are close to each other.
