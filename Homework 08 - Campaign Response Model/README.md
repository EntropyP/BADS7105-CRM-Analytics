## What I did
More feature engineering, such as
* Tenure, Length of stay
* Time to event
* Monetary, Frequency, and Ticket Size for the past 6, 12, 18, 24 months
* Velocity of spending for the short period over longer period, e.g, 12 over 24 months

## Result

## Future Improvements
* Proper model evaluation by using train-test-valid split and cross validation
* SHAP Tree Explainer
* Proper Feature Selection
* Hyperparamter tuning, maybe Optuna
* LightGBM
